## System update
First thing you need to do, on any OS actually, is update the system! For that: **Apple Icon > About This Mac** then **Software Update...**.

## System preferences
If this is a new computer, there are a couple of tweaks I like to make to the System Preferences. Feel free to follow these, or to ignore them, depending on your personal preferences.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:
- Trackpad > Tap to click
- Keyboard > Key Repeat > Fast (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Delay Until Repeat > Short (all the way to the right)
- Dock > Automatically hide and show the Dock

## Security
I recommend checking that basic security settings are enabled.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:
- Users & Groups: If you haven't already set a password for your user during the initial set up, you should do so now
- Security & Privacy > General: Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins
- Security & Privacy > FileVault: Make sure FileVault disk encryption is enabled
